My goal is to get enabled more & more, get more independent from artificial means of communications as keryboard, mouse , pad, syntax & rules that stems out of imperfactions of technology.
Soemday I would look at software as talking with people. because when we talk with others , actually we are programming them in some ways & getting programed from them. This is the ultimate goal of software technology.
